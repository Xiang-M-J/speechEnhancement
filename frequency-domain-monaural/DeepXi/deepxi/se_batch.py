	Places all of the test waveforms from the list into a numpy array.
	SPHERE format cannot be used. 'glob' is used to support Unix style pathname
	pattern expansions. Waveforms are padded to the maximum waveform length. The
	waveform lengths are recorded so that the correct lengths can be sliced
	for feature extraction. The SNR levels of each test file are placed into a
	numpy array. Also returns a list of the file names.

	Inputs:

		fnames - filename/s of the waveforms.
		snr_l - list of the SNR levels used.

	Outputs:
		wav_np - matrix of paded waveforms stored as a numpy array.
		len_np - length of each waveform strored as a numpy array.
		snr_test_np - numpy array of all the SNR levels for the test set.
